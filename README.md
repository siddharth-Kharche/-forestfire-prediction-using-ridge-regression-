# FWI Prediction Streamlit App

This is a Streamlit web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using a Ridge regression model. The model is trained on a dataset with features like Temperature, RH (Relative Humidity), Wind Speed, Rain, and more. The app allows users to input these values and get a prediction.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Users can input weather parameters directly through the app interface.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: The app returns FWI predictions instantly based on the user inputs.
- **Pre-trained Model**: The Ridge regression model is pre-trained and loaded for instant predictions.

## How to Use the App

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fwi-prediction-streamlit-app.git
    cd fwi-prediction-streamlit-app
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501/` in your browser.

## Model & Data

- **Ridge Regression Model**: A trained Ridge regression model stored as a pickle file (`ridge.pkl`).
- **Standard Scaler**: A `StandardScaler` is used to normalize the input data before prediction (`scaler.pkl`).

## Files in the Repository

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app file.
- `models/`: Directory containing the pre-trained `ridge.pkl` model and `scaler.pkl`.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Instructions and details about the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **scikit-learn**: For the Ridge regression model and data preprocessing.
- **Python**: Main language for building the app.
